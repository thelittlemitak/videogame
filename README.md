- I decided to start a video game using Phaser 3 in order to keep coding while looking for my first job and still focusing on JavaScript (the frontend language) so I don't get much out of my learning path (meaning: it would be easier now to use Unity or Godot to do a first video game and take advantadge of their UI but they don't use JS natively).
- Node modules are _git-ignored_ so if you want to see the project for the time being (no compiled version yet), you will have to go to the desired local folder and, together with cloning the repo there, run the '**npm install**' command inside this one to get the Phaser dependencies.
